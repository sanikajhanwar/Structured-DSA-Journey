# Structured-DSA-Journey
Tracking my DSA progress based on Take U Forward (Striver's) Sheet using LeetCode.
This repo logs the topics and questions Iâ€™ve completed â€” not full solutions â€” and will be updated regularly as I continue.

### âš¡ Note

I've already completed a significant number of problems from Take U Forward (Striver's) DSA Sheet, covering topics like Basics, Arrays, Binary Search, Strings, Linked List, Recursion, Bit Manipulation, Stack and Queue, Sliding Window, and Two-Pointer. I'll be updating this repository soon with all the problems I've solved so far, and from now on, I'll continue adding the new topics I'm currently working on.

You can also check out my Take U Forward Profile or LeetCode Profile (linked below) to see the progress I've already made.

This repository starts tracking from **July 4, 2025**, and I will gradually upload my previously solved problems along with new ones moving forward.
